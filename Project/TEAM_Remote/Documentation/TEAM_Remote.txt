Module "MCUC1"     (component McuLibConfig)

Module "LEDPin1"   (component BitIO)
   - LEDPin1_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - LEDPin1_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory 
                or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - LEDPin1_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - LEDPin1_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if 
                the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - LEDPin1_NegVal -Negates (inverts) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(!GetVal())]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "TI1"       (component TimerInt)

Module "TU1"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.

                for the console access.

                new line has been detected, the line will be parsed using the handlers in the table.

                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read.
   - AS1_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - AS1_RecvBlock -If any data is received, this method returns the block of the data and its length (and incidental error), 
                otherwise it returns an error code (it does not wait for data).  This method is available only if non-zero 
                length of the input buffer is defined and the receiver property is enabled.  If less than requested number of 
                characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user specified 
                destination. The value ERR_EXEMPTY is returned and the value of variable pointed by the Rcv parameter is set to 
                the number of received characters.
   - AS1_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters to the channel.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output 
                buffer is defined and the transmitter property is enabled.
   - AS1_ClearRxBuf -Clears the receive buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the input buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled.
   - AS1_ClearTxBuf -Clears the transmit buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled.

                property is enabled.
   - AS1_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled.

Module "TmDt1"     (component GenericTimeDate)
   - TmDt1_AddTick -Increments the tick counter of the software RTC. Needs to be called periodically by the application to 
                increase the time tick count.
   - TmDt1_AddTicks -Same as AddTick(), but multiple ticks can be added in one step.
   - TmDt1_CalculateDayOfWeek -Returns the day of the week, Sunday starting as zero. Monday is 1, ...
   - TmDt1_SetTime -This method sets a new actual time of the software RTC.
   - TmDt1_GetTime -This method returns current time from the software RTC.
   - TmDt1_SetDate -This method sets a new actual date of the software RTC.
   - TmDt1_GetDate -This method returns current date from the software RTC.
   - TmDt1_SetTimeDate -This method sets a new actual time and date of the RTC.
   - TmDt1_GetTimeDate -This method returns current time and date from the RTC.
   - TmDt1_SetSWTimeDate -This method sets a new actual time and date of the software RTC.
   - TmDt1_GetSWTimeDate -This method returns current time and date from the software RTC.
   - TmDt1_SetInternalRTCTimeDate -This method sets a new actual time and date of the internal hardware RTC.
   - TmDt1_GetInternalRTCTimeDate -This method returns current time and date from the hardware RTC.
   - TmDt1_SyncWithInternalRTC -Synchronizes the software RTC with date and time from the internal hardware RTC
   - TmDt1_SyncSWtimeToInternalRTCsec -This method synchronizes the software RTC with the internal HW RTC. Because the internal 
                RTC only counts seconds, we sync on a second change.
   - TmDt1_SetExternalRTCTimeDate -This method sets a new actual time and date of the external hardware RTC.
   - TmDt1_GetExternalRTCTimeDate -This method returns current time and date from the external hardware RTC.
   - TmDt1_SyncWithExternalRTC -Synchronizes the software RTC with date and time from the hardware RTC. Note that if that RTC 
                interface requires interrupts, this function should be called only when interrupts are enabled.
   - TmDt1_UnixSecondsToTimeDateCustom -Transforms a given time/date into the Unix time stamp, with the number of seconds from 
                a starting date
   - TmDt1_UnixSecondsToTimeDate -Transforms a given time/date into the Unix time stamp, with the number of seconds after 
                1-Jan-1970
   - TmDt1_TimeDateToUnixSecondsCustom -Returns for a given time/date the corresponding UNIX time stamp with a custom base date.
   - TmDt1_TimeDateToUnixSeconds -Returns for a given time/date the corresponding UNIX time stamp, starting at 1-Jan-1970.
   - TmDt1_AddDateString -Adds a formatted date string to a buffer
   - TmDt1_AddTimeString -Adds a formatted time string to a buffer
   - TmDt1_DeInit -Deinitializes the driver.
   - TmDt1_Init -Initialization method
